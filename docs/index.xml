      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve reached my blog! Welcome!
This is my personal blog where I record what I have learnt and read throughout the years.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on programming stuff and some books about finance. But maybe there will be more categories as I continue my journey of learning.
There&amp;rsquo;s a motto that I love very much, which I heard from the youtuber Yes Theory:
Seek Discomfort We should all be brave enough to step out of comfort zone and try seek discomfort few times a year.</description>
